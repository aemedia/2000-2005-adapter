= Arel Testing Setup

You should have both rails and the adapter cloned to your typical repo folder. Let's say this 
would be ~/repos referred to as REPOS. As of current make sure your rails checkout is at master
and the sqlserver adapter on the "3.0.0.beta1" topic branch. Make sure to remote track that 
origin topic branch. It's typically good practice to do your work on a local branch of that 
remote tracking branch.

In your environment set RAILS_SOURCE & ARSQLSERVER_SOURCE to the full path of your local repos
for each of rails and the adapter above. You should now be able to run "bundle install" from 
this project root. From here you can start testing, but it is best practice to use the 
"bundle exec ..." commands. For instance:

  $ bundle exec rake spec:sqlserver
